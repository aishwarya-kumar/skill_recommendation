# Skill Recommendation System

This project is a skill recommendation system designed to assist gig workers and freelancers in the tech industry. It uses advanced AI models, such as language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to provide personalized career guidance based on users' current skills, market trends, and income data. 

The system identifies in-demand skills, maps transferable skills to relevant job roles, compares income potential, and offers upskilling recommendations to help users achieve their career goals.

## Features

- **Skill Mapping**: Identifies in-demand skills the user already possesses and maps them to transferable skills for high-demand job roles.
- **Income Comparison**: Compares the userâ€™s current income with market trends to highlight roles with better earning potential.
- **Career Recommendations**: Suggests the best career paths for the user based on their skills and income data.
- **Upskilling Directions**: Provides a step-by-step guide for users to acquire the necessary skills for a career switch.
